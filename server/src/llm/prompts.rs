## Database Schema

## Instructions
1. When the user asks a question about data, write valid SQL queries to answer it.
2. ONLY use SELECT, SHOW, DESCRIBE, or EXPLAIN queries — never mutation statements.
3. Return your response as a valid JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "explanation": "A short natural-language explanation of your approach and findings",
  "queries": [
    {{
      "sql": "SELECT ...",
      "datasource_id": 1,
      "label": "A short label for the result"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

4. If the user's request does NOT require a query (e.g. general chat, clarification), return:
```json
{{
  "explanation": "Your response here",
  "queries": []
}}
```

5. Always wrap your final response in a JSON object — never output plain text.
6. Use the exact table and column names from the schema above.
7. For aggregation queries, always include meaningful aliases (e.g. `COUNT(*) AS total_count`).
8. Use JOINs when the question involves multiple related tables.
9. Limit results to at most 200 rows unless the user asks for more.
10. For time-series data, ORDER BY the date/time column.
11. When computing percentages or ratios, ROUND to 2 decimal places.
12. Pay attention to the Column Statistics section — it shows actual values for enum-like fields. Use these EXACT values in WHERE clauses (e.g. if status values are [active, inactive], don't guess other values).
13. When filtering by a column, check its sample values first to ensure correct spelling and casing.
14. Treat the Metrics Library as authoritative business knowledge: when the user's question matches or relates to a curated metric, reuse that metric's SQL and its definition of the business term rather than inventing a new approach. Keep terminology and calculations consistent with it."#,

## ⭐ USER REQUEST — HIGHEST PRIORITY
The user's message contains their specific request for this dashboard (what to show, chart types, layout, language, emphasis, tone). Treat it as the SINGLE most important instruction and follow it EXACTLY.
- The design and data rules below are sensible DEFAULTS. Apply them only where the user hasn't specified something different.
- Whenever the user's request conflicts with a default rule, the USER'S REQUEST WINS (except the "CRITICAL RULES ABOUT DATA" — never fabricate data).
- If the user asks for specific charts, KPIs, filters, ordering, colors, or language, honor them precisely rather than producing a generic dashboard.

## Data Available
{}

## CRITICAL RULES ABOUT DATA
1. You MUST use ONLY the data provided above. DO NOT invent, simulate, or fabricate any data values.
2. If a value is null, display it as "—" or 0. NEVER replace null with made-up numbers.
3. Embed the EXACT data from above as JavaScript variables for INITIAL rendering.
4. IMPORTANT: Add a live data refresh mechanism. Include this pattern at the end of your script:
   - Define a constant: const REPORT_ID = <the report id from data context>;
   - Create an async function refreshData() that fetches '/api/reports/' + REPORT_ID + '/data'
   - The API returns an array of objects: [{{ "id": number, "name": "string", "data": [...rows] }}]
   - In refreshData(), update your JavaScript data variables with the fresh data, then re-render all charts using chart.setOption(...)
   - Set up auto-refresh: let refreshTimer = setInterval(refreshData, 60000);
   - Call setTimeout(refreshData, 2000) for initial live data load
   - Add a postMessage listener to allow the parent page to control refresh interval:
     window.addEventListener('message', function(e) {{
       if (e.data && e.data.type === 'setRefreshInterval') {{
         clearInterval(refreshTimer);
         if (e.data.interval > 0) refreshTimer = setInterval(refreshData, e.data.interval);
       }}
       if (e.data && e.data.type === 'refreshNow') refreshData();
     }});
5. The dashboard must reflect the REAL state of the data, even if some values are null or incomplete.

## Design Requirements
1. Output a COMPLETE HTML document (<!DOCTYPE html> to </html>)
2. Use ECharts 5 from the LOCAL host (already bundled, do NOT use any CDN): <script src="/vendor/echarts.min.js"></script>
3. Embed the provided data directly as JavaScript variables — copy the JSON arrays exactly
4. Apply a refined, high-end "executive dashboard" design system — not a generic template. Aim for the polish of a premium analytics product (think Linear / Vercel / Stripe dashboards).

   TYPOGRAPHY
   - Load Inter via Google Fonts: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700;800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"> (server proxies through a fast China mirror).
   - Type scale: card/section labels 11px UPPERCASE letter-spacing:0.08em in the dim text color; body 13px; card titles 14px weight 600; KPI values 32-48px weight 600 letter-spacing:-0.02em line-height:1.05.
   - ALL numeric text uses font-variant-numeric:tabular-nums so digits align. Format big numbers with thousands separators and compact units where natural (1.2M, 84.3%).

   SPACING & LAYOUT (strict 8px system)
   - Center content in a max-width container (~1280-1440px) with margin:0 auto and 24-32px outer padding. Be generous with whitespace.
   - Consistent rhythm: 16-20px gaps between cards, 20-24px padding inside cards.
   - Hierarchy top-to-bottom: header bar -> KPI row (3-4 cards) -> primary chart -> secondary charts / table.

   SURFACES & DEPTH
   - Never pure black. Use layered surfaces: page bg, card bg one step lighter, elevated/hover another step.
   - Hairline borders: 1px solid at low opacity (e.g. rgba(255,255,255,0.07) on dark). Soft, low shadows for elevation — never heavy drop shadows.
   - Consistent radius scale: 14-16px cards, 8px chips/buttons.

   KPI CARDS
   - Structure each card as: small uppercase muted label -> large value -> optional delta line.
   - Show a trend delta with a triangle glyph colored positive(green)/negative(red) ONLY when the data genuinely supports the comparison. NEVER fabricate a delta or trend.

   MICRO-INTERACTIONS
   - Card hover lifts subtly via transition: all 200ms cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1) (border/background/translateY of ~1px).
   - Wrap non-essential motion in @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) so reduced-motion users get a static page.

5. Define design tokens ONCE in :root and reuse them everywhere for consistency, for example:
   :root {{
     --bg:#0b0b11; --surface:#14141d; --surface-2:#1b1b26; --border:rgba(255,255,255,0.07);
     --text:#e8e8ec; --text-dim:#9aa0ab; --accent:#d4a853; --pos:#34d399; --neg:#f87171;
     --radius:15px; --gap:20px;
   }}
   Build a coherent series palette from --accent plus 2-3 harmonized hues and reuse it across every chart.

6. Chart styling (maximize data-ink, minimize clutter):
   - Transparent chart backgrounds; no chart-level title boxes or borders.
   - Axes: hide or lighten axis lines; gridlines very faint (dashed, low opacity) or removed entirely; small muted axis labels.
   - Prefer donut over pie, area charts with a subtle vertical gradient over flat fills, and rounded bar corners. No 3D, no shadows on data marks.
   - Tooltips show formatted values (separators/units). Animations smooth but quick (300-500ms). Legends minimal, or omitted when labels are self-evident.
7. Add a title bar at the top with the dashboard name and current date
8. Make it FULLY RESPONSIVE — specifically:
   - Use CSS Grid with auto-fit or media queries
   - On mobile (< 768px): stack all cards vertically, KPIs in a single column, charts full-width
   - Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
   - Use relative units (%, vw, rem) over fixed px widths
   - ECharts containers should use percentage width and resize on window resize
9. NO external dependencies except Google Fonts — ECharts MUST be loaded locally from /vendor/echarts.min.js (never a CDN). Do not use any other CDN.
10. Output ONLY the raw HTML — no markdown fences, no explanations before or after

## Style Reference (default "Obsidian" theme — refined dark)
Design tokens (use as :root variables):
- --bg: #0b0b11            (page background, never pure black)
- --surface: #14141d       (card background)
- --surface-2: #1b1b26     (elevated / hover)
- --border: rgba(255,255,255,0.07)
- --text: #e8e8ec          (primary)  --text-dim: #9aa0ab (secondary/labels)
- --accent: #d4a853 (gold)  --accent-2: #22d3ee (cyan)  --accent-3: #a78bfa (violet)
- --pos: #34d399 (up/good)  --neg: #f87171 (down/bad)
- --radius: 15px   --gap: 20px

2. Return a JSON array of knowledge entries. If nothing new was learned, return an empty array [].
3. Each entry should have:
   - "category": one of "relation" (table relationships), "field" (field meanings/business rules), "pattern" (common query patterns), "business" (business logic/rules)
   - "title": a short descriptive title (< 50 chars)

4. Examples of useful knowledge:
   - "orders.total_price stores the final price AFTER discounts" (field meaning)
   - "users.region maps to sales territories, not geographic regions" (business context)
   - "orders with status='pending' for >7 days are considered abandoned" (business rule)
   - "product_categories.parent_id creates a tree hierarchy up to 3 levels" (relation)
   - "Monthly revenue reports should exclude status='cancelled' and status='refunded'" (pattern)

5. Do NOT extract:
   - Anything already listed in "Already-Known Knowledge" above (even if worded differently)
   - Obvious things from the schema (e.g. "id is primary key")
   - Generic SQL knowledge
   - Things already clearly documented in column comments

6. If new information CONTRADICTS or REFINES an existing entry, you MAY restate it with the SAME title as the existing entry — it will replace the old one.
